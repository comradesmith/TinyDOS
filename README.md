# TinyDOS

## 1. What is TinyDOS?

TinyDOS is a very very simulation of a disk operating system. I wrote this as part of an
assignment for my Computer Science diploma in my Operating Systems class.

The main challenge with this assignment was keeping track of a directory/file tree using
only block level reads and writes to the "drive"

## 2. What components are in TinyDOS?

TinyDOS is made up of 3 python modules, and 6 classes. Orgininally the module drive.py was
provided by my lecturer, Robert Sheehan.

The other two modules and 5 classes were written by me.
